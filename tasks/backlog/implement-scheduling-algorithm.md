# Implement Scheduling Algorithm

## Priority
Low

## Created
2025-08-03

## Description
Develop the core scheduling algorithm that can automatically generate valid timetables while respecting all constraints and optimizing for preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research and choose algorithm approach (CSP, Genetic, etc.)
- [ ] Implement constraint validation engine
- [ ] Create schedule generation logic
- [ ] Add conflict detection
- [ ] Implement optimization for soft constraints
- [ ] Support partial manual assignments
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add progress feedback for long operations
- [ ] Implement solution ranking

## Technical Details
### Algorithm Considerations
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach
- Backtracking with constraint propagation
- Heuristics for variable/value ordering
- Local search for optimization
- Possible use of OR-Tools or similar library

### Constraints to Handle
- Teacher availability
- Room capacity
- Subject hour requirements
- No double-booking
- Break times
- Pedagogical constraints
- Teacher preferences

### Performance Goals
- Generate valid schedule for 12 classes in < 30 seconds
- Handle 25 teachers, 15 rooms
- Support incremental changes
- Provide multiple solution options

## Notes
- Consider using existing CSP libraries
- May need to implement custom heuristics for German school system
- Should support "what-if" scenarios
- Plan for scalability to larger schools
- Consider parallel processing for performance

## Research Resources
- Google OR-Tools
- Python-constraint library
- Academic papers on school timetabling
- Genetic algorithm approaches

## Dependencies
- All data models must be complete
- Constraint system must be defined
- API structure established
