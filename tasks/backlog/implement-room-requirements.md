- [ ] Define room types (classroom, lab, gym, etc.)
- [ ] Create RoomFeature model for equipment tracking
- [ ] Link subjects to required room features
- [ ] Add room availability management
- [ ] Implement room booking validation
- [ ] Support shared rooms between classes
- [ ] Add distance/transition time constraints
- [ ] Create room utilization reports
- [ ] Handle maintenance/blocked periods

## Technical Details
### Model Structure
```python
class Room:
    id: int
    name: str
    code: str
    room_type: Enum (CLASSROOM, GYM, MUSIC, ART, COMPUTER, etc.)
    capacity: int
    building: str (optional)
    floor: int (optional)
    features: List[RoomFeature]
    
class RoomFeature:
    id: int
    name: str (projector, piano, lab_equipment, etc.)
    
class SubjectRoomRequirement:
    subject_id: int (FK)
    room_type: Enum (optional)
    required_features: List[int] (FK to RoomFeature)
    preferred_rooms: List[int] (FK to Room)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/rooms` - List all rooms with features
- `POST /api/v1/rooms` - Create new room
- `GET /api/v1/rooms/{id}/availability` - Check room availability
- `POST /api/v1/rooms/{id}/block` - Block room for maintenance
- `GET /api/v1/rooms/utilization` - Utilization report
- `GET /api/v1/subjects/{id}/suitable-rooms` - Get suitable rooms

### Validation Rules
- Room capacity must accommodate class size
- Required features must be present
- Check room availability before booking
- Consider transition time between buildings
- Prevent overbooking

## Dependencies
- Subject model must be complete
- Schedule model must integrate room validation
- Class model (for size validation)

## Notes
- German schools often have specialized rooms (Fachr√§ume)
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Outdoor spaces for Sport may have weather dependencies
- Shared facilities between schools may need coordination
