## Priority
High

## Created
2025-08-03

## Description
Create a constraint-based scheduling algorithm that can automatically generate valid timetables respecting all hard constraints and optimizing for soft constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver
- [ ] Define hard constraints (must satisfy)
- [ ] Define soft constraints (optimize)
- [ ] Create backtracking algorithm with constraint propagation
- [ ] Add heuristics for variable/value ordering
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Support partial manual assignments
- [ ] Add progress reporting for long operations
- [ ] Create solution quality metrics
- [ ] Support multiple solution generation

## Technical Details
### Algorithm Architecture
```python
class SchedulingAlgorithm:
    def solve(
        constraints: List[Constraint],
        fixed_assignments: List[Schedule],
        optimization_goals: List[Goal]
    ) -> Solution
    
class Constraint:
    type: Enum (HARD, SOFT)
    weight: int (1-10 for soft constraints)
    check(): bool
    
class Solution:
    schedules: List[Schedule]
    score: float
    satisfied_constraints: List[Constraint]
    violated_constraints: List[Constraint]
```

### Hard Constraints (Must Satisfy)
- No teacher double-booking
- No class double-booking  
- No room double-booking
- Respect break periods
- Teacher availability
- Room capacity
- Subject-teacher qualifications
- Weekly hour requirements per subject

### Soft Constraints (Optimize)
- Minimize teacher gaps between lessons
- Distribute subjects evenly across week
- Place difficult subjects in morning
- Minimize room changes for classes
- Respect teacher preferences
- Group related subjects
- Balance teacher workload
- Minimize empty periods in timetable

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/schedule/generate` - Generate new schedule
- `POST /api/v1/schedule/optimize` - Optimize existing schedule
- `GET /api/v1/schedule/generation/{job_id}/status` - Check progress
- `POST /api/v1/schedule/validate-constraints` - Validate solution

## Dependencies
- All models must be complete (Teacher, Class, Subject, Room, TimeSlot, Schedule)
- Teacher availability system
- Teacher-subject assignments
- Room requirements

## Algorithm Research
- Consider OR-Tools for constraint solving
- Evaluate python-constraint library
- Research school timetabling papers
- Consider genetic algorithm as alternative

## Performance Requirements
- Generate schedule for 12 classes in < 30 seconds
- Support 25+ teachers, 15+ rooms
- Handle 200+ weekly lessons
- Provide progress updates every 5 seconds

## Notes
- Start with basic backtracking, optimize later
- Consider caching constraint evaluations
- May need different strategies for different school sizes
- German schools have specific pedagogical constraints
- Consider parallel processing for performance
