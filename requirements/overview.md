# Grundschule Timetabler - Requirements Overview

## Project Vision
Create an intuitive, efficient timetabling system that helps German Grundschule principals and administrators manage the complex task of creating yearly schedules while respecting all constraints and regulations.

## Problem Statement
Currently, many Grundschule principals spend weeks each year manually creating timetables using spreadsheets or paper-based methods. This process is:
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Difficult to optimize for multiple constraints
- Hard to adjust when changes are needed
- Lacking in conflict detection
- Not easily shareable with staff

## Solution Goals
1. **Automation**: Reduce manual work through intelligent scheduling algorithms
2. **Validation**: Automatically detect and prevent scheduling conflicts
3. **Flexibility**: Easy adjustments and what-if scenarios
4. **Compliance**: Built-in support for German education regulations
5. **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## Success Criteria
- Reduce timetable creation time from weeks to days
- Zero scheduling conflicts in generated timetables
- Support for all standard Grundschule requirements
- Positive user feedback from pilot schools
- Successful handling of mid-year changes

## Scope

### In Scope
- Timetable creation for grades 1-4
- Teacher assignment and availability management
- Room allocation
- Basic substitute teacher planning
- Export to common formats (PDF, Excel)
- German language interface

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Integration with existing school management systems
- Student individual schedules
- Exam planning
- Budget management
- Parent communication features

## Stakeholders
1. **Primary Users**
   - School principals (Schulleiter/in)
   - Assistant principals (Konrektor/in)
   - Administrative staff

2. **Secondary Users**
   - Teachers (viewing their schedules)
   - Substitute coordinators
   
3. **Indirect Stakeholders**
   - Students (affected by schedule quality)
   - Parents (affected by schedule changes)
   - School board (compliance requirements)

## High-Level Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create and manage academic year timetables
2. Assign teachers to classes and subjects
3. Allocate rooms and resources
4. Detect and resolve conflicts
5. Generate reports and exports
6. Handle substitute arrangements

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: Generate timetables in under 1 minute
2. Usability: Learnable in under 2 hours
3. Reliability: 99.9% uptime during critical periods
4. Security: GDPR compliant data handling
5. Compatibility: Works on modern browsers
6. Localization: Full German language support

## Constraints
- Must comply with state education regulations
- Must protect personal data according to GDPR
- Must work within typical school IT infrastructure
- Must be accessible to users with varying technical skills

## Assumptions
- Schools have basic internet connectivity
- Users have access to modern web browsers
- Schools can provide teacher availability data
- One person is responsible for timetabling per school

## Risks
1. **Technical Risks**
   - Algorithm complexity for constraint satisfaction
   - Performance with large schools
   - Data migration from existing systems

2. **User Adoption Risks**
   - Resistance to change from paper-based methods
   - Training requirements
   - Trust in automated solutions

3. **Regulatory Risks**
   - Changes in education regulations
   - Data privacy requirements
   - State-specific requirements

## Development Approach
Iterative development with regular user feedback:
1. MVP with core scheduling features
2. Pilot testing with 1-2 schools
3. Iterative improvements based on feedback
4. Gradual feature expansion
5. Full release after successful pilot phase
