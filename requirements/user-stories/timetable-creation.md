# User Story: Timetable Creation

## As a School Principal
I want to create a complete timetable for the upcoming school year
So that all classes, teachers, and rooms are efficiently scheduled

## Acceptance Criteria
1. I can specify the academic year and term dates
2. I can define daily time slots (e.g., 8:00-8:45, 8:45-9:30)
3. I can set break times that apply to all classes
4. I can create a timetable for all grade levels (1-4)
5. The system validates that all required subjects are scheduled
6. The system shows me any conflicts or issues immediately
7. I can save drafts and return to them later
8. I can generate a complete timetable with one click (auto-scheduling)

   - Define which subjects can be double periods

3. **Manual or Automatic Creation**

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start
Maria is creating a timetable for the new school year. She has 12 classes (3 per grade level), 25 teachers, and must schedule 10 different subjects with varying weekly hours.

### Scenario 2: Mid-Year Adjustment
Thomas needs to adjust the existing timetable because a teacher is going on maternity leave and a new part-time teacher is joining.

### Scenario 3: Special Events
Lisa needs to temporarily modify the timetable for a project week where normal scheduling doesn't apply.

## Edge Cases
- Teacher calls in sick on the day timetable is being created
- New regulatory requirement changes subject hours mid-planning
- Classroom suddenly unavailable due to maintenance
- Part-time teacher availability changes

## Technical Notes
- Must handle concurrent editing (if multiple people work on it)
- Should support undo/redo for all operations
- Auto-save every 5 minutes
- Ability to compare different versions

## Success Metrics
- Time to create complete timetable: < 4 hours
- Number of manual conflict resolutions needed: < 10
- User satisfaction score: > 4/5
- Successful first-time generation rate: > 80%
